        <h2>Welcome to Robert's Project Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Explore Robert's projects, skills, and achievements.</p>
        <p>I'm making this portfolio project website to create a clear guide for my work.
        It's like a central place where I can show off the things I've done and talk about what
         I'm good at. This way, when I want to share my work with others, like potential clients or employers, it's all organized in one spot. It's not just for them, though â€“ it's also for me. This website will help me see how I've grown and what skills I've developed over time. So, it's like a simple guide to who I am professionally.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Main Point to Focus</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Showcase Work: The main goal is to effectively showcase my projects, highlighting the skills and expertise I bring to the table. Each project should be presented in a way that's easy to understand for anyone visiting the website.</li>
            <li>Provide Clarity: Create a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for visitors to navigate through the portfolio. A clear and simple structure ensures that people can quickly find the information they're looking for without any confusion.</li>
            <li>Reflect Growth: Use the portfolio as a timeline to illustrate my professional journey. Include a section that demonstrates how my skills have evolved over time, showcasing a progression that reflects continuous learning and improvement.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate Diversity: Ensure that the portfolio represents a diverse range of projects, emphasizing different skills and aspects of my work. This diversity provides a more comprehensive view of my capabilities and versatility.</li>
            <li>Encourage Engagement: Incorporate features that invite interaction, such as a contact form or links to social media profiles. This encourages visitors to reach out for potential collaborations, job opportunities, or to simply engage in a conversation about the showcased work.</li>
